# Use of JavaScript leaflet library and API to elaborate visualizations.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to elaborate visualization showing the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes in all the world in the last seven days and with this data create map with different layers. To accomplish this project, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and subtract geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes our purpose is to use JavaScript and D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. And use the Leaflet library to plot the data in a Mapbox map through an API.

## Challenge overview
Basil and sadhana like how we created the earthquake map with two different maps and earthquake overlay. Now we are creating a visualization to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plateâ€™s location on the earth, and they wanted to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. They also want to display 3 different maps.

- Street Map View
- Satellite Map View
- Dark Map View
